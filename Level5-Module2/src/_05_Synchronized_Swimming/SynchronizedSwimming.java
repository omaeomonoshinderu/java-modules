/*
 * Synchronization is a mechanism which ensures that two concurrent processes (threads)
 * do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment. When one thread wants
 * to execute the synchronized code, a lock (also known as a "mutex") must be acquired.
 * If another thread wishes to acquire the same lock, it must wait for the other thread
 * to release the lock first. This is most commonly used to make sure two threads can't
 * read from or write to the same variables/objects at the same time.
 *
 * Challenge: Two swimmers want to swim in the same pool at the same time. However, the
 * pool is not big enough for both of them. These are world-class swimmers, and it only
 * takes them 2 seconds to complete a lap! They have agreed to each take turns swimming
 * one lap at a time. Your job is to make sure they follow the rules.
