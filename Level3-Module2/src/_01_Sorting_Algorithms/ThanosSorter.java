    /*
     * Thanos Sort is the sorting algorithm used by mighty titan Thanos.
     * When Thanos observes that the array is unsorted, he simply snaps his
     * fingers and removes half of the array items to bring balance to the
     * array. Thanos will keep snapping his fingers until the remaining
     * elements are completely sorted.
     * For example:
     * int[] arr = {12, 100, 200, 201, 97, 33, 100, 687};
     * 
     * Thanos looks at this array from left to right and sees the the first
     * element that isn't greater than the previous one is 97
     * (12, 100, 200, 201 are all in order). In quiet rage, Thanos randomly
     * picks half of the elements in the array and removes them. In this case
     * he removes the second half, so the array now looks like:
     * {12, 100, 200, 201, 0, 0, 0, 0} // second half removed
     * 
     * The remaining non-0 values are now in order and balance is restored to
     * the array. If Thanos removed the first half, the array would be:
     * {0, 0, 0, 0, 97, 33, 100, 687}
     * 
     * The first unordered number is 33, so Thanos snaps his fingers and removes
     * half again:
     * {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 100, 687} // first half
     * or
     * {0, 0, 0, 0, 97, 33, 0, 0} // second half
     * 
     * If the first half is removed the result is sorted. If the second half is
     * removed 33 isn't sorted so Thanos snaps his fingers again! The result is
     * either:
     * {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 33, 0, 0} // first half
     * or
     * {0, 0, 0, 0, 97, 0, 0, 0} // second half
     * 
     * NOTE: The algorithm doesn't necessarily have to take away half from the
     * front or back of the array. You can implement an algorithm that takes
     * elements away randomly until half (in this case (n-1)/2) remain. The
     * algorithm is up to you!
