//   A Thread Pool is a way of managing multiple threads with multiple workloads.
//   It works by collecting a list of tasks to be performed by a thread.
//   A pool of threads is then created, and each thread takes a task from the list and does that work.
//   This continues until all the tasks are done.
//   When all the tasks are complete, the thread pool has finished its job.
//   This test will use a Thread pool to convert a large amount of lower case characters to upper case

//1. Fill in the ThreadPool and Worker classes and the Task interface according to the Thread Pool UML Diagram.
